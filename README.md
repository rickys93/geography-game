# GeoGenius
GeoGenius is a geography game that features a welcome page, 2 games called 'Flag Frenzy' and 'Country Quiz', and a leaderboard page.

## Flag Frenzy
In Flag Frenzy, a flag is displayed on the screen and the player must guess the country that the flag represents. The game includes a variety of flags from different countries. It's a fun way to test and improve your knowledge of flags and countries.

## Country Quiz
Country Quiz is a game where players are presented with 5 questions about a country. The questions cover various geographical information including the country's location in the North/South hemisphere, continent, capital city, population, and official language. The game is designed to test and improve player's knowledge of different countries and their characteristics.

## Installation & Usage
To run the app, you have two options:

1. You can download the source code and open the index.html file in a web browser. This will run the app locally on your computer.
2. Alternatively, the app is also deployed on Render.com and can be accessed via the following URL: https://geo-genius.onrender.com/. This will run the app from the deployed location. (If you would like to run the server as well, you will need to clone and run the following repo - https://github.com/rickys93/geo-genius-server)

Once the app is running, you can navigate to the different pages using the navigation menu at the top of the page. The welcome page will provide an overview of the app and instructions on how to play the games. The Flag Frenzy and Country Quiz pages will take you to the respective games, where you can start playing right away. The leaderboard page will display the current high scores for the games.

## Process
The GeoGenius project was developed as an educational game for a group of schools. The goal was to create an interactive and engaging way for students to learn about geography. The project was developed by a team of three using Agile methodologies.

The development process began with a brainstorming session to identify the key features and functionality of the game. The team then broke down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and assigned them to individual team members. The team used Agile methodologies, including daily stand-up meetings and sprint planning, to track progress and ensure that the project stayed on schedule.

The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The team chose these technologies because of their versatility and ease of use. The development timeline for the project was four days in total, and it was completed on time.

During the development process, the team did not have time to implement a proper testing and debugging process. The team focused on building the app, then deployed it on render.com, which is a free platform. However, the free version meant that it was slow to deploy new changes, which was an issue.

Overall, the GeoGenius project was a success, and it was well received by the schools that used it. The team learned a lot about the development process and Agile methodologies, and they are looking forward to applying their knowledge to future projects.
